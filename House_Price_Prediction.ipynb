    "\"Housing - humanity's simple, yet complex and timeless paradigm. Families and individuals, buyers and sellers, and businesses and investors all continually try to crack the code - finding the right housing price to balance one's life and future. Predicting housing prices is an invaluable, yet frustrating endeavor. \" - Blake Cizek \n",

    "How much is your home worth? People normally measure or predict housing prices in terms of their intuition, or the factors of price known to them like location and size. However, there are, in fact, as many as hundreds of factors affecting housing prices, which makes it very difficult to assess and quantify to determine the relationship between a factor and the prices.  Wouldn't it be nice if we can have a magic box that can output the predicted or \"fair\" housing price once we input the factors? We come pretty close to that when we apply the power of machine learning. This project involves training several machine learning models that use the house features and attributes to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa. We examined the features to determine which features are important and which are not, developed multiple machine learning models, and compiled the results to take advantage of the strongest point of the different models.\n"
