    "Purchasing a home is one of the most life-changing decisions that people make. It is pivotal that a prospective home buyer makes this purchase at the correct price. However, when facing a decision of such financial magnitude, people may consider that they are paying more for the house than it’s worth. Previously the complexity of this task led people to simply take the price of the house and divide by the total square feet, obtaining a price per square foot which one could compare to other houses in the neighborhood.  Now with the data and increased computational power, we are able to increase the sophistication of our analysis based on a house’s features. However, because of different reasons, it is still necessary to extrapolate to the house actually being purchased. This project created models to find the best way of predicting housing prices in certain areas to make the process more transparent. The goal of this project is to enable house buyer having a better way of estimating house prices, and evaluating houses before purchasing.\n"

    "The data was compiled by Dean De Cock and published in https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview. The dataset under analysis was the House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques set on Kaggle.com.  The location of the houses sold was in Ames, Iowa during the period 2006 to 2010.  There were 1460 houses and their sale prices for 79 features (e.g. the number of bathrooms, square footage, overall quality rating). The goal is to predict the prices of another set of houses for which the prices were not provided.\n",
    "Of the 79 explanatory variables, we found that 51 are categorical and 28 are continuous. We discovered that each predictor variable could be categorized into variables such as lot/land, location, age, appearance, external features, room/bathroom, kitchen, basement, roof, garage, and utilities, etc.\n",

All the other columns except SalePrice will be fitted then in the models as features. Imputations to missing values will be talked about in the part of feature engeneering. "

Based on the situation that larger area number usually leads to higher prices, it seems the two data points are for some reason recorded by mistake, so they are removed. <img src=\"pics/scatter1.png\">"
