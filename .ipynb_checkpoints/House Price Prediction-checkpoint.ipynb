    "\"Housing - humanity's simple, yet complex and timeless paradigm. Families and individuals, buyers and sellers, and businesses and investors all continually try to crack the code - finding the right housing price to balance one's life and future. Predicting housing prices is an invaluable, yet frustrating endeavor. \" - Blake Cizek \n",

    "How much is your home worth? People normally measure or predict housing prices in terms of their intuition, or the factors of price known to them like location and size. However, there are, in fact, as many as hundreds of factors affecting housing prices, which makes it very difficult to assess and quantify to determine the relationship between a factor and the prices.  Wouldn't it be nice if we can have a magic box that can output the predicted or \"fair\" housing price once we input the factors? We come pretty close to that when we apply the power of machine learning. This project involves training several machine learning models that use the house features and attributes to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa. We examined the features to determine which features are important and which are not, developed multiple machine learning models, and compiled the results to take advantage of the strongest point of the different models.\n"

    "The data was compiled by Dean De Cock and published in https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview. It includes 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, and 2930 observations/houses, our goal is to predict the sales price for each house evaluated on Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)\n",
    "Of the 79 explanatory variables, we found that 51 are categorical and 28 are continuous. We discovered that each predictor variable could be categorized into variables such as lot/land, location, age, appearance, external features, room/bathroom, kitchen, basement, roof, garage, and utilities, etc.\n",
    "Here is a glimpse of the variables:\n",
    "Continuous variables: relate to various area dimensions, such as the size of the living area, the basement, and the porch;\n",
    "Discrete variables: quantify the number of items occurring within the house, such as number of rooms, baths, kitchens, parking spots, etc;\n",
    "Nominal variables: identify various types of dwellings, garages, materials, and environmental conditions;\n",
    "Ordinal variables: rate various items within the property.\n",
